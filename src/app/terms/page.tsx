              <div>
                A chargeback is a reversal of a credit/debit card transaction by
                your bank. Chargebacks are usually performed when fraudulent
                purchases have been made on a person’s credit/debit card. You
                can initiate such a request if you find a charge on your account
                that you did not authorize, or a charge for an item that you did
                not receive. If you need to request a chargeback, please contact
                us first so we can help you resolve the issue. In most cases,
                our refund policy is the appropriate route to take instead of a
                chargeback request.
